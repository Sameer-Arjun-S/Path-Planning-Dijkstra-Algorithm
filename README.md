Following are the libraries required for running the code:

import cv2
import numpy as np
import time 
import heapq
import pygame

If pygame is not installed then install using the following command:
!pip install pygame


In this program pygame is used initially to visualize the game boundary
Later half plane equations are used to solve for the obtimum path using Dijkstra algorithm

Inputs from user:
Robot initial coordinates in x and y coordinates
Robot target coordinates in x and y coordinates
